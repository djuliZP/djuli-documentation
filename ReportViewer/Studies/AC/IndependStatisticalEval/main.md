# Independ Statistical Evaluation

If enabled, the report includes a group of cards with statistics creating a fit independently on each data line. It consists of three elements: Error Table, Values Table and Statistics Table.

***Parameters:***

​		**Error Table:** Calculate the concentration error for each sensor

​		**Values Table:** Calculate the calibrated concentration value on each sensor.

​		**Statistics Table:** Calculate statistics for each sensor fit. **R-squared**, **Intercept** value, **Intercept Standard Error %**, Slope (**X**), Slope Standard Error (**X SE%**), Limit of Detection (**LoD**), Limit of Quantification (**LoQ**), coefficient **C0** and **C1**.
