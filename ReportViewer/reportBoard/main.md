**RÂ² :** *A number between 0 and 1 indicating how well the body of the data fits with the model*

**Coefficients:**  *X and Intercept are coefficients that describe the model equation. They can also be seen as an annotation on the fit graph*

**SE%:** *The standard error associated with each coefficient represented as a percentage of the coefficient value*

**Limit of Blank(LoB):** *Limit of blank represents the highest quantity value, of blank material, that may be observed and is expressed as a probability*

**Limit of detection(LoD):** *Limit of detection represents the lowest quantity that can be detected from a signal*

**Limit of quantitation(LoQ):** *Limit of quantitation represents the smallest concentration of a substance that is detectable from a signal*

**Reciprocal coefficients:** *C1 and C2 are reciprocal coefficients, because it can be more convenient to rewrite the model equation from                                                     (Y = X+ intercept) to (X =C1 x Y + C0)*
